We address this gap by studying how county-level conditions—economic resilience, population change, and community health—intersect with individuals’ political orientations and communication patterns to shape partisan evaluations. Our context is Wisconsin around the 2012 election, with our focus on two prominent political figures: Governor Scott Walker and President Barack Obama. Multilevel modeling reveals that partisans living in counties with more affluent, less precarious conditions during 2009–2012 exhibited more polarized partisan attitudes toward Walker and Obama. Our analysis also finds a significant role for interpersonal communication and digital media in shaping polarized attitudes.","tags":null,"title":"Do Improving Conditions Harden Partisan Preferences?

However, scholarly attention has focused on social media, overlooking the role that news media within the country played in amplifying false, foreign messages. In this article, we examine articles in the U.S. news media system that quoted IRA tweets through the lens of changing journalism practices in the hybrid media system, focusing specifically on news gatekeepers’ use of tweets as vox populi. We find that a majority of the IRA tweets embedded in the news were vox populi. That is, IRA tweets were quoted (1) for their opinion, (2) as coming from everyday Twitter users, and (3) with a collection of other tweets holistically representing public sentiment. These findings raise concerns about how modern gatekeeping practices, transformed due to the hybrid media system, may also unintentionally let in unwanted disinformation from malicious actors.","tags":null,"title":"The Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing: How Russia’s Internet Research Agency Tweets Appeared in U.S. News as Vox Populi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiyoun Suk","Aman Abhishek","Yini Zhang","So Yun Ahn","Teresa Correa","Christine Garlough","Dhavan V.

We argue that sharing experiences of trauma in digital spaces created a network of acknowledgment, which supported and sustained nascent #MeToo activism based on the logic of connective action. This article attempts to (a) understand the temporal dynamics of these different discourses within the #MeToo movement on Twitter, (b) reveal the accounts animating these discourses and the most prominent themes within them, and (c) model the overtime relationship between these discourses and their relationship to major news event and #MeToo revelations. To do so, we analyze a 1% sample of tweets from the 5-month period following the revelations about Harvey Weinstein in early October 2017, employing a range of computational approaches, including part-of-speech tagging, dependency analysis, hashtags extraction, and retweet network analysis—to identify key discourses, actors, and themes. We then conduct time series analysis to identify the relationship between the two discourses and predict how the ebbs and flows of each discourse are shaped by news events.","tags":null,"title":"#MeToo, Networked Acknowledgment, and Connective Action: How “Empowerment Through Empathy” Launched a Social Movement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yini Zhang","Dhavan Shah","Jordan Foley","Aman Abhishek","Josephine Lukito","Jiyoun Suk","Sang Jung Kim","Zhongkai Sun","Jon Pevehouse","Christine Garlough"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557878400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557878400,"objectID":"2befcf5dcc53ada8113eb18a9b151d7e","permalink":"https://jiyounsuk.github.io/publication/zhang-whose-2019/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T20:45:58.929051Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-whose-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This study focuses on the outpouring of sympathy in response to mass shootings and the contestation over gun policy on Twitter from 2012 to 2014 and relates these discourses to features of mass shooting events. We use two approaches to Twitter text analysis—hashtag grouping and supervised machine learning (ML)—to triangulate an understanding of intensity and duration of “thoughts and prayers,” gun control, and gun rights discourses. We conduct parallel time series analyses to predict their temporal patterns in response to features of mass shootings. Our analyses reveal that while the total number of victims and child deaths consistently predicted public grieving and calls for gun control, public shootings consistently predicted the defense of gun rights. Further, the race of victims and perpetrators aﬀected the levels of public mourning and policy debates, with the loss of black lives and the violence inﬂicted by white shooters generating less sympathy and policy discourses.","tags":null,"title":"Whose Lives Matter?

Meanwhile, social media outlets like Twitter have become a central platform for such attention. In this paper, we propose to detect patterns of issue attention on mass shootings by tracing the volume of relevant tweets. We compiled two datasets using both traditional and computational methods. One dataset is of mass shooting events, and the other is of tweets about mass shootings on Twitter. Our focus is twofold, as we conceptualize social media discourse as both an indicator and a construction of issue attention. First, we examine the longitudinal trend of issue attention in association to mass shooting events. Second, we deconstruct the issue attention into discursive themes and check the variation among those themes. We explore how mass shooting event features affect the ebbs and flows of issue attention.","tags":null,"title":"Tweeting Mass Shootings: The Dynamics of Issue Attention on Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"School of Journalism and Mass Communication, UW-Madison Instructor\n Effects of Mass Communication, J565 (Fall 2019)  Teaching Assistant\n Introduction to Mass Communication, J201 (Fall 2016)  Workshop\n  Computational Methods Research Group  School of Journalism, UT-Austin Teaching Assistant\n Food: Culture and Agriculture (Spring 2016) Freedom: Philosophy/History/Law (Fall 2015)  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://jiyounsuk.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"School of Journalism and Mass Communication, UW-Madison Instructor\n Effects of Mass Communication, J565 (Fall 2019)  Teaching Assistant\n Introduction to Mass Communication, J201 (Fall 2016)  Workshop\n  Computational Methods Research Group  School of Journalism, UT-Austin Teaching Assistant","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"page"}]
